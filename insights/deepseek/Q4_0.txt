The recurring theme across the insights is the necessity to distinguish between **technical descriptive text** and **sentiment expressive text** in software engineering (SE) to ensure accurate sentiment analysis. Technical text often includes jargon, code snippets, and URLs, which lack emotional content, while sentiment-expressive text conveys emotions or attitudes. Misclassification arises when general sentiment analysis tools misinterpret technical terms as emotional expressions, leading to unreliable results.

To optimize sentiment analysis in SE texts, the following combined insight is proposed:

1. **Preprocessing**: Remove non-sentiment-related elements like code snippets, URLs, and technical keywords. Retain sentiment-expressive features such as emoticons, negation phrases, and contractions. Filter out domain-specific stop words (e.g., "error," "support") that may carry emotional connotations in general language but are neutral in SE contexts.

2. **Domain-Specific Tools**: Use SE-specific sentiment analysis tools (e.g., **Senti4SD**, **SentiStrength-SE**) trained on datasets from platforms like GitHub, JIRA, and Stack Overflow. These tools leverage domain-specific lexicons, keyword-based features (e.g., n-grams), and semantic features (e.g., word embeddings) to better differentiate between neutral technical descriptions and emotionally loaded text.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: Employ advanced models like **RoBERTa** combined with **TextCNN** to capture contextual nuances and sentence structures. This helps identify indirect sentiment expressions and distinguish neutral technical descriptions (e.g., "critical issue") from genuine sentiment (e.g., frustration or satisfaction).

4. **Manual Validation**: Incorporate expert annotation and multi-annotator validation to refine sentiment classification. Use established emotion models (e.g., Shaverâ€™s framework) to guide labeling and resolve ambiguities.

By combining preprocessing, domain-specific tools, contextual analysis, and manual validation, sentiment analysis in SE texts can achieve higher accuracy, ensuring that only genuinely sentiment-expressive text is analyzed while filtering out neutral technical content.
