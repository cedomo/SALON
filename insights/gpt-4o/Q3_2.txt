Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because software engineering texts often contain detailed issue descriptions alongside sentiments. This separation helps accurately identify sentiments, as technical descriptions may not convey emotions, leading to more reliable sentiment analysis results in SE texts.

The paper proposes using sentence structures to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts. It introduces filter rules to identify sentiment-expressive sentences by matching patterns such as direct sentiment indicators (e.g., exclamation marks, emojis), decorated sentiment patterns (e.g., adverbs modifying sentiment words), and specific sentence structures (e.g., first-person expressions, judgment patterns). Sentences that do not fit these patterns are considered technical descriptions and are filtered out. This approach helps focus sentiment analysis on parts of the text where the author is likely expressing emotions, improving the accuracy of sentiment detection.
