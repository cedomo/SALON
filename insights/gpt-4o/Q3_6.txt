Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical texts often contain jargon and problem descriptions that may be misclassified as negative by general sentiment analysis tools, leading to inaccurate sentiment detection in software engineering contexts.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests using a sentiment analysis classifier specifically trained for the domain, like Senti4SD. This classifier leverages a combination of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features tailored to the software engineering context. By using a gold standard dataset from Stack Overflow, Senti4SD can better understand the domain-specific use of language and reduce the misclassification of neutral technical texts as negative. The approach involves analyzing the context and meaning of words using distributional semantics, which helps in accurately identifying sentiment expressions amidst technical jargon.
