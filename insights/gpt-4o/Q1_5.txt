The paper proposes SEntiMoji, an emoji-powered approach for sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts. It addresses the challenge of limited labeled SE data by leveraging emoji usage as noisy sentiment labels. The approach involves two stages: first, it fine-tunes the DeepMoji model, originally trained on Tweets, using GitHub posts to incorporate technical jargon. This results in a sentiment-aware representation model called DeepMoji-SE. In the second stage, DeepMoji-SE is used to generate vector representations of SE-related texts, which are then employed to train a sentiment classifier using the available labeled data. This method captures both general sentiment patterns from social media and domain-specific expressions from technical texts, significantly improving sentiment analysis performance on SE tasks compared to existing methods.
