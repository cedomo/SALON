To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper suggests using SE-specific sentiment analysis tools that are fine-tuned for the software engineering domain. It emphasizes the importance of platform-specific tuning due to the unique jargon and communication styles of different collaborative development environments. The study highlights that lexicon-based tools, such as SentiStrength-SE and DEVA, perform better in cross-platform settings when retraining is not possible. However, supervised tools like Senti4SD and SentiCR can achieve better performance when retrained with a balanced and high-quality gold standard dataset. The paper also stresses the need for a robust gold standard with substantial inter-rater agreement to ensure reliable training. Additionally, it recommends conducting a preliminary sanity check by manually annotating a sample from the target platform to verify alignment with the tool's output, ensuring the tool's suitability for the specific research goals.
