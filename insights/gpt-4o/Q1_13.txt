To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper suggests using sentiment analysis tools specifically tailored for the software engineering domain. These tools are designed to address the unique characteristics of software engineering communication, such as technical jargon and context-specific expressions. The paper highlights the importance of using a robust dataset, like PRemo, which contains manually labeled messages from GitHub pull request discussions. This dataset is curated using a systematic process involving experts from different fields to ensure accuracy and reduce subjectivity. The sentiment analysis tools are evaluated based on their performance in classifying messages as positive, negative, or neutral. The study emphasizes the need for tools that can handle the subtleties of software engineering communication, such as sarcasm and mixed emotions, and suggests that current tools still have room for improvement in accurately classifying negative sentiments.
