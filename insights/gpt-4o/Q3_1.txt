Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical terms often have domain-specific meanings that do not convey emotions. Misinterpreting these terms as sentimental can lead to inaccurate sentiment analysis, as seen with tools trained on non-technical data.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, the paper suggests creating a domain-specific dictionary tailored for software engineering. This involves identifying and neutralizing technical terms that have different meanings in a technical context compared to general sentiment. Additionally, incorporating contextual analysis can help, such as recognizing when words are used in a technical sense versus an emotional one. The use of heuristics, such as identifying neutralizer words and proper nouns, and preprocessing steps to filter out code snippets and URLs, further aids in accurately distinguishing between technical and sentiment-laden text.
