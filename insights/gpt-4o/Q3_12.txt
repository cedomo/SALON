Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical text often conveys factual information without sentiment, while sentiment expressive text reflects opinions or emotions. Accurate sentiment analysis requires identifying and focusing on the latter to avoid misinterpretation in software engineering contexts.

The paper suggests that distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text involves identifying linguistic cues and context that indicate sentiment. Technical descriptive text typically presents factual information, such as code descriptions or technical specifications, without emotional undertones. In contrast, sentiment expressive text contains subjective language, emotional expressions, or evaluative terms that convey opinions or feelings. The use of specialized sentiment analysis tools or models trained on software engineering datasets can help in accurately identifying sentiment expressive text by focusing on these linguistic markers and contextual clues, ensuring that sentiment analysis captures genuine opinions rather than neutral technical descriptions.
