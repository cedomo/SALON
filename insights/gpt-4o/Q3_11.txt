Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because it helps ensure the reliability of sentiment analysis. Technical descriptions may be misclassified as negative sentiment due to domain-specific vocabulary, leading to inaccurate conclusions about developers' emotions or attitudes.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, it is important to develop clear guidelines for the labeling process, ensuring that evaluators can differentiate objective reports of facts from affective states expressed in the text. This involves training classifiers to recognize domain-specific vocabulary and context, which can help avoid misclassification of technical terms as negative sentiment. Additionally, leveraging both project-specific and non-project-specific keywords as features for training classifiers can improve performance. Incorporating a mixture of software-related and unrelated data for pre-training can also enhance the tool's ability to accurately identify sentiment in software engineering contexts.
