The paper discusses the development of SentiCR, a sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for software engineering (SE) texts, particularly code review comments. Traditional sentiment analysis tools, which are effective for social media or product reviews, perform poorly on SE datasets due to the presence of technical jargon, code snippets, and unique communication styles. To address this, the authors manually labeled 2000 code review comments to create a training dataset. They evaluated existing sentiment analysis tools and found them inadequate, prompting the development of SentiCR. This tool uses supervised learning, specifically the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) algorithm, which achieved the highest accuracy, precision, and recall in identifying negative sentiments. The process involves data preprocessing steps like expanding contractions, removing URLs, handling emoticons, and negation preprocessing to improve classification accuracy. SentiCR is trained on a domain-specific dataset, making it more effective for SE texts.
