Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because general-purpose sentiment analysis tools often misinterpret technical jargon as sentiment-laden, leading to inaccurate results. SE-specific tools aim to address this by better understanding the context and semantics of software engineering communication.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests using SE-specific sentiment analysis tools that are fine-tuned to understand the domain-specific jargon and context. These tools often incorporate customized lexicons and supervised learning models trained on annotated datasets from software engineering platforms. Additionally, a sanity check against manual labeling is recommended to ensure the tool's suitability for the research goals. This involves assessing the tool's performance on a sample dataset to verify its ability to accurately capture sentiment without being misled by technical terms that may have different meanings outside the domain.
