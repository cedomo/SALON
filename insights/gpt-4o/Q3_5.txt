Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical jargon can lead to misclassification in sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis tools often misinterpret domain-specific terms, affecting accuracy. Identifying sentiment expressive text ensures more reliable sentiment detection in software engineering contexts.

The paper suggests leveraging emoji usage data to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering. Emojis, often used to convey emotions, can serve as noisy labels for sentiment, helping to identify sentiment-laden expressions. By employing a representation learning approach that uses both Tweets and GitHub posts containing emojis, the model can learn sentiment-aware representations. This method captures general sentiment patterns from social media and incorporates technical jargon from developer communications, allowing for more accurate differentiation between technical descriptions and sentiment expressions in software engineering texts.
