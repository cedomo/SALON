Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical texts may contain neutral terms that could be misclassified as negative sentiments, and complex sentence structures can obscure actual sentiments, leading to inaccurate sentiment analysis in software engineering contexts.

The paper suggests that distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text can be achieved by incorporating pre-trained transformer models like RoBERTa into a TextCNN framework. This approach leverages RoBERTa for word embedding to capture contextual semantics and uses TextCNN to classify sentiments by analyzing groups of adjacent words. The framework also introduces residual connections to enhance cooperation between RoBERTa and TextCNN, allowing the model to better identify and differentiate sentiment expressions from technical descriptions, thus addressing challenges like misclassification of neutral technical terms and complex sentence structures in software engineering texts.
