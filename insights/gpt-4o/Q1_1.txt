The paper introduces SentiStrength-SE, a tool specifically designed for sentiment analysis in software engineering texts. The approach involves creating a domain-specific dictionary tailored for software engineering, addressing the limitations of existing sentiment analysis tools that were trained on non-technical texts. The process includes identifying domain-specific meanings of words, context-sensitive variations, and other challenges unique to software engineering texts. SentiStrength-SE incorporates heuristics to improve sentiment detection, such as handling negations, filtering out code snippets, and identifying proper nouns. The tool is built on top of the original SentiStrength, leveraging its lexical approach while enhancing it with domain-specific insights. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SentiStrength-SE significantly outperforms domain-independent tools like NLTK and Stanford NLP in detecting sentiments in software engineering texts, confirming the effectiveness of a domain-specific approach.
