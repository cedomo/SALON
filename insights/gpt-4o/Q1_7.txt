To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper suggests using SE-specific sentiment analysis tools rather than general-purpose ones, as the latter may not accurately capture the nuances of technical language and developer communication. The study highlights the importance of retraining these tools on domain-specific datasets to improve accuracy. It also recommends performing a sanity check to ensure the chosen tool aligns with the research goals, as different tools may have varying conceptualizations of affect. If retraining is not feasible, using an ensemble of multiple tools with a majority voting system can enhance performance. Additionally, the paper advises being cautious about the unit of analysis, as sentiment analysis tools may perform differently on short versus long texts. Overall, the study emphasizes the need for careful selection and potential customization of sentiment analysis tools in the software engineering domain.
