Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical texts often contain domain-specific language that may not convey sentiment, while sentiment expressive texts reflect emotions. This distinction helps improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis tools in the software engineering domain.

The paper suggests that distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text involves analyzing the context and language used in the text. Technical descriptive texts often contain domain-specific terminology and focus on factual information, such as code descriptions or bug reports, without conveying emotions. In contrast, sentiment expressive texts include subjective language, emotional expressions, or opinions, often found in developer discussions or feedback. By identifying linguistic cues and context, sentiment analysis tools can differentiate between these text types, allowing for more accurate sentiment detection in software engineering contexts. This distinction helps tailor sentiment analysis to the unique characteristics of software-related communications.
