The paper introduces Senti4SD, a sentiment analysis classifier specifically designed for software engineering texts. It addresses the limitations of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools, which often misclassify technical jargon and problem reports as negative due to their training on non-technical domains. Senti4SD is trained on a gold standard dataset of Stack Overflow posts, annotated for sentiment polarity. It utilizes a combination of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features, including word embeddings, to accurately detect sentiment in developers' communication. The classifier reduces the misclassification of neutral and positive posts as negative, achieving a 19% improvement in precision for negative sentiment and a 25% improvement in recall for neutral sentiment compared to the baseline tool, SentiStrength. The approach is validated through empirical evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the domain-specific use of language in software engineering.
