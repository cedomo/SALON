To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper suggests using sentiment analysis tools specifically adapted for the software engineering (SE) domain. These tools often employ machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers, which are popular due to their effectiveness. Additionally, some tools are based on neural networks, like BERT-based models, which have shown promising results. The paper highlights the importance of using domain-specific tools, such as SentiStrength-SE and Senti4SD, which are tailored to handle the unique language and context of SE texts. These tools are trained on data from platforms like GitHub, JIRA, and Stack Overflow, which are rich sources of SE-related communication. The paper also notes challenges such as handling sarcasm and subjectivity in manual labeling, suggesting that future research should focus on improving cross-platform performance and addressing these issues.
