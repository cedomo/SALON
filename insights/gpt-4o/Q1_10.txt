The paper proposes an approach named EASTER for sentiment analysis on software engineering (SE) texts by integrating pre-trained transformer models with TextCNN. EASTER uses RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT model, for word embedding to capture the semantics of SE texts. TextCNN, a convolutional neural network designed for sentence classification, is employed for the downstream sentiment classification task. The framework includes a residual connection to enhance cooperation between RoBERTa and TextCNN. This setup aims to address the unique challenges of sentiment analysis in SE texts, such as indirect sentiment expression and complex sentence structures. The approach is evaluated on datasets from various software information sites, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalizability compared to existing sentiment analysis tools. EASTER effectively identifies sentiments in SE texts, leveraging the strengths of both pre-trained models and CNN architectures.
