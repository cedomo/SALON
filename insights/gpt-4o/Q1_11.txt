To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, researchers often use sentiment polarity detection tools, which classify text as positive, neutral, or negative. Tools like SentiStrength, Senti4SD, and SEntiMoji are specifically designed for software engineering contexts and generally perform better than general-purpose tools. However, the performance of these tools can vary depending on the type of data, such as issue reports, Stack Overflow posts, or code reviews. It is crucial to evaluate the reliability of these tools when applied to different contexts, as their accuracy can be unsatisfactory if not properly customized. Researchers are encouraged to use datasets from the same data source for training and to consider domain-specific vocabularies to improve accuracy. Additionally, capturing affective states rather than just sentiment polarity can provide more nuanced insights into developers' emotions and attitudes.
