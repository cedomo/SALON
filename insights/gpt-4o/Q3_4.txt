Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical text often contains neutral information, while sentiment expressive text reveals developers' emotions and opinions. This distinction helps accurately assess sentiment, improving understanding of developers' interactions and the impact on software productivity and quality.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests using preprocessing techniques to filter out non-sentiment-bearing elements like code snippets, URLs, and stop words. It involves identifying sentiment-laden words, emoticons, and punctuation that convey emotions. The approach also includes using machine learning classifiers trained on labeled datasets to categorize text as either neutral or sentiment-expressive. By focusing on words and patterns indicative of sentiment, such as positive or negative adjectives and verbs, the method effectively separates technical descriptions from emotional expressions, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis in software engineering contexts.
