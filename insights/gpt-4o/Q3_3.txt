Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because software engineering texts often contain technical jargon, code snippets, and URLs that do not convey sentiment. Accurate sentiment analysis requires focusing on the actual sentiment-expressive content to avoid misclassification and improve analysis accuracy.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps. These include removing URLs and code snippets, which do not convey sentiment, and handling word contractions and emoticons that can influence sentiment. The paper also recommends using a customized stop-word list to exclude non-semantic words and programming keywords. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of negation preprocessing to accurately capture sentiment by identifying and modifying negation phrases. These steps help focus on sentiment-expressive content, improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis in software engineering contexts.
