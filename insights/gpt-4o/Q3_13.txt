Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical texts are often neutral, lacking emotional content, while sentiment expressive texts contain opinions or emotions. This distinction helps improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis tools in software engineering contexts.

The paper suggests distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text by employing a robust manual labeling process guided by an established emotion model, such as Shaver's model. This involves experts from different fields, like neuroscience and software engineering, to classify messages based on their emotional content. Technical descriptive texts are typically neutral, focusing on factual information, while sentiment expressive texts convey opinions or emotions, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. The process includes analyzing the context of messages, identifying specific words or expressions that denote sentiment, and considering additional context like previous or following messages.
