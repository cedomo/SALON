# README

This folder stores all the results of experiments mentioned in the essay. The name of each result is formatted like below:

```
(extraction model name)_(classification model name)_(base prompt)
```

To be more specific, *extraction model name* refers to the LLM model we use to extract the insights from essays; *classification model name* refers to the LLM model we use to execute the classification tasks; *base prompt* refers to the prompt we enhance with the insight.

In each folder, we stores the *.csv* and *.txt* files of each experiment. *px.y* in the name represents different combinations of questions and essays. *x* represents the question index (Q1 or Q3), while *y* represents the essay index(the order is slightly different from that in our essay). In particular, *px.y* represent the integrated insight when *x* is 4.
